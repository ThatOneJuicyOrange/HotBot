Despite their sheep like characteristics, they rarely grow larger than a chihuahua due to their very slow aging. Flooferts can live upwards of 500 years, but people often mistake them as babies because of their size. If you pick up a floofert and look into its eyes, you can hear their thoughts. It's silence.",
